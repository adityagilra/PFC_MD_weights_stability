# Thalamo-Cortical Reinforcement Learning
Reproducing experiments from Michael Halassa's lab.  
  
This project uses my [rateSimulator module / repo](https://github.com/adityagilra/rateSimulator).  
1. We implement Miconi 2017 reinforcement learning via node perturbation. -- DONE!  
2. We test it for simple tasks.  
3. We put in medio-dorsal thalamust and pre-frontal cortical circuits and learn the Schmitt, et al 2017 tasks.  
4. We learn the Rikhye et al, in prep., tasks. The MD and PFC tunings and circuit properties must match experiments.
